# neural-network-from-scratch
My own challenge to implement machine learning models like linear regression, multilayer perception, transformer, etc. from scratch!

I manually implemented neural network build blocks such as nodes, activation functions, backpropagation, optimizers, etc. myself.

## Multilayer perceptron
- Achieves an accuracy on the MNIST handwriting dataset at around 88-90%

## Transformers
- Implement according to this blueprint

- Trained and tested on simple Thai romanization (Thai to Latin transliteration):
